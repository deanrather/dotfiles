# Going from Sublime to Intellij


## Installation

IntelliJ IDEA requires Java, but it comes self-contained with it, so you don't have to install java yourself first.

## Plugins

- When you open a (markdown, bash, etc.) file, a notification will inform you that there's plugins for that file type
- After installing a plugin, a notification at the bottom will ask you to restart
